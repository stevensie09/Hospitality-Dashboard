## Features / Highlights

### Business Problem
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to assist them with insights from their historical data.

### Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive visual platform that:  
- Enables hotel managers to monitor occupancy, revenue, and guest satisfaction metrics.  
- Supports strategic decisions for pricing, marketing, and resource allocation.  
- Uncovers trends in booking patterns, room preferences, and cancellation rates across cities and hotel categories.
