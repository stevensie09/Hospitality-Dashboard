# 🏨 Hospitality Insights: Global Hotel Bookings Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore hotel booking trends across multiple cities, focusing on occupancy rates, revenue analysis, guest preferences, and hotel performance metrics.

## Short Description / Purpose
The Hospitality Insights Dashboard is a Power BI report designed to analyze booking data for hotels across various cities, providing insights into occupancy, revenue, guest demographics, and booking patterns. It serves hotel managers, tourism analysts, and business strategists to optimize operations and enhance customer experiences.

## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Primary platform for creating interactive reports and visualizations.  
• 📂 **Power Query** – Used for data transformation, cleaning, and preparation of CSV datasets.  
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic aggregations, and conditional logic.  
• 📝 **Data Modeling** – Relationships established among tables (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings) for seamless cross-filtering.  
• 📁 **File Format** – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Data Source
**Source**: Internal hotel booking database (provided as 5 CSV files: dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings).  
**Description**: The dataset includes booking details for hotels across multiple cities, covering dates in May, June, and July 2022. It includes hotel properties, room types, booking statuses, revenue metrics, and guest information, enabling comprehensive analysis of hospitality trends.

## Features / Highlights

### Business Problem
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to assist them with insights from their historical data.

### Goal of the Dashboard
To provide an interactive visual platform that:  
- Enables hotel managers to monitor occupancy, revenue, and guest satisfaction metrics.  
- Supports strategic decisions for pricing, marketing, and resource allocation.  
- Uncovers trends in booking patterns, room preferences, and cancellation rates across cities and hotel categories.
